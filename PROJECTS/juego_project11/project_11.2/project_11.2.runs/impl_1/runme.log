WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net stateMachine/NS__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin stateMachine/FSM_onehot_NS_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell stateMachine/FSM_onehot_NS_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
