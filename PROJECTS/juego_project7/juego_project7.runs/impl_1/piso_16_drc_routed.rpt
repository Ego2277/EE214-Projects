PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell led_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_reg[10]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_reg[10]_LDC_i_1/O, cell led_reg[10]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
